          <h3>Hi, I am Yuan.</h3>
          <p>I like to learn new tech and code things.</p>

          <article class="ramblings">
            <p>
              Some things I learnt and a few thoughts I had while making this page.
            </p>

            <p>
              I tried a few different ways to implement the card display and ultimately settled on using scroll to
              trigger
              drawing and stashing the cards. At first I tried keeping a container element at a single position and
              trigger
              the corresponding card effects when moving above or below certain points and then snap back to the fixed
              position. This gave the animation a nice elastic bouncing effect but with the different ways scroll is
              implemented across browsers it was more trouble than it was worth. Touch events were ok, but then I had to
              account for scroll events anyway so might as well ditch everything and just use scroll as the control for
              the
              app.
            </p>

            <p>
              While the card transitions are triggered by scroll events, most of the actual work is done outside of the
              listener to ensure that the app will not become choppy or unresponsive. Once certain conditions are met an
              item(an async function) is created and added to a queue with the cards to be processed. The queue
              automatically handles the items added and calls them sequentially, waiting until the current one is
              finished
              before calling the next. This way no matter how many items are created by the scroll events, the rate that
              they are processed will always remain constant. With everything happening inside a single queue, timing
              the
              animations becomes trivial and controlling the flow also becomes a lot easier, such as just emptying the
              entire queue when changing scroll directions.
            </p>

            <p>
              My favourite part of the whole thing is probably the ability to stop the animation by scrolling in the
              opposite direction, the code for it is super simple yet it just works so well. While the animation might
              be
              playing for the 5th card, the index and the queue could already be up to the 10th card depending on the
              scrolling speed. By adding a callback to the queue items with the index and scroll position when the item
              was
              first queued I can then use these references to set the scroll position and index to the last item that
              was
              poll creating a seamless transition.
            </p>

            <p>
              The navigation for the tabs on larger screens uses a setTimeout for the deck closing animation, this
              creates
              opportunities where a sort of race condition can occur when the tabs are clicked too fast. When navigating
              away from the projects tab, if the animation hasn’t finished playing the first tab clicked will always
              render
              at the end no matter how many tabs are clicked afterwards. One way to solve this was to make it so you
              can’t
              click on another tab until the first clicked tab has loaded, but this makes the UI clunky and
              unresponsive.
              The solution I used was to keep track of the latest clicked tab on a variable, storing it as the property
              value of an object. By passing the object when this value is requested it will always reflect the latest
              tab
              selected(very similar to the useRef hook in React). Any tab to be rendered has to match the value in this
              variable otherwise it’s discarded, this way only the last tab clicked will be rendered. …thought a better
              method would probably be where setTimeout isn’t needed at all.
            </p>

            <p>
              The overlapping card effect was surprisingly easy to implement, have one element containing all the
              details
              of
              the card and then have an outer element that wraps around this element. Set the width of the outer element
              smaller than the width of the card and the browser takes care of the rest, now you have an inline
              overlapping
              card effect without doing anything else. To implement an expanding card effect a bit of JS is needed, the
              width of each line of cards needs to be calculated and assigned. The width needs to be a size where
              there’s
              enough space for a card to fully expand into but not enough that it can fit in an extra card, otherwise
              the
              UI
              will jump all over the place due to line wrapping every time a card expands.
