                <h3>The difference between absolute, relative, and fixed positioning</h3>

                <p>
                    Absolute, relative, and fixed these are all inputs for the position property of an HTML element and as the name suggests they all relate to how an element is positioned on the page. The element's final position will then be decided by the left, right, top, and bottom properties.
                </p>

                <h4>Static positioning</h6>
                  <p>
                    To better understand the three it's best to go over static positioning first, this is the default value for the position property if nothing is specified. When an element is statically positioned the properties left, right, top, and bottom will have no effct on it. If the position property has any value other than static the elment is counted as 'positioned'.
                  </p>
                  <br>

                <h4>Absolute positioning</h6>
                <p>
                  An absolute positioned element is placed relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor element, positioned meaning non static and ancestor is any container that wraps the element within it. If no suitable ancestor is found, the element will position itself relative to the first box(containing-block). The page will also not take any absolute positioned elements into account when creating the layout.
                </p>

                <br></br>
                <h4>Relative Positioning</h4>
                <p>
                  Might seem a bit confusing at first but relative in this case is acutally relative to the element itself. Initially the element is positioned normally within the page when it is first created. Any adjustments made by the left, right, top, and bottom properties will be made relative to this intial position.
                </p>
                <img class="auto-resize" src="../../images/relative.png" alt="The red div is moved 50px left and 70px down relative to its origininal position.">
                <br></br>

                <h4>Fixed Positioning</h4>
                <p>
                  With fixed positioning the element is palced relative to the viewport/browser window rather than anything on the page. This means that if you fixed an element to the bottom corner by setting its top and left attributes to 0 it will always remain at the position even when you scroll or reisze the window. Like absolute positioning, fixed positioned elements will not be taken into account for the page layout.
                </p>
                <img class="auto-resize" src="../../images/fixed.png" alt="The position of the red div is fixed to the bottom right corner of the screen. It stays even when screen scroll or resize.">
