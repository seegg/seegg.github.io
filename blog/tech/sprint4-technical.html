                    While it’s been mostly smooth sailing so far, there were a few problems that gave me pause. One of the simpler ones was finding all the relevant commands on the terminal. I was unfamiliar with Ubuntu and getting used to the commands for the terminal took some time. The solution for this was quite simple as well, commit the basics to memory and when anything unfamiliar comes up just look it up online.

                <p>
                    Another problem that came up quite a few times was just trying to understand what the question was asking. Some of the programming questions were a bit cryptic on their requirements and require some trial and error to understand what’s going on. One solution that was quite easy and straightforward was to log the input, basically asking the function to tell me what data is being used. This gave me a lot of context into what a question was asking.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                        <p>
                            I sometimes find it helpful to map out a function with words before trying to code it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Trying something</h4>
                        <p>Never try it.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
                        <p>
                            Going over the code and explaining it an inanimate object was helpful in finding problems in my code.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
                        <p>
                            This one was really useful in understanding what went wrong, and for the messages that I don’t understand I can just search it online.
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Console.log</h4>
                        <p>
                            I use logging liberally throughout my code, both to understand what is going on as well as debugging.
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Googling</h4>
                        <p>
                            My number one go to option for problem solving, my thought process is basically ‘the problems and errors I’m seeing have probably been experienced by countless others before and the answer is already posted for all to see’. Hasn’t failed me yet.
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Asking peers for help</h4>
                        <p>
                            It’s sometimes useful to see a problem from another perspective.
                        </p>
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                        <p>
                            Reflecting on a problem after solving it leads to a better understanding in the same type of problems in general.
                        </p>
