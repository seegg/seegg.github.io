                    Emotional intelligence(EI) measures the capability of an individual to recognise and deal with emotions in themselves as well as those around them. To recognise your current mood and understand why you are feeling this way and then knowing how to adjust and motivate yourself accordingly to accomplish the task at hand. Beyond your own emotions, EI also is a measure of a personâ€™s ability to empathize and understand the emotional state of others around them.

                <p>
                    EI and IQ although similar in that both are about understanding and problem solving, they differ in that IQ deals with logic and knowledge in a specific subject or subjects while EI deals with recognising emotions in yourself and others. IQ is the ability to comprehend logic and abstract ideas, EI is the capability to understand and utilise emotions to accomplish goals and tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The ability to understand and utilise emotions is an important aspect in dealing with any unexpected events as well as help to better manage social and professional relationships. In situations where stress and negative emotions will cripple your progress a high EI will allow you to better understand and work around the problem. Studies have shown EI has a positive relationship with job success as well as relationship satisfaction.
