                <p><i>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</i></p>
                <p>I should be less dismissive, I need to concentrate more, I enjoy thinking in my head than constantly sharing my thoughts.</p>

                <p><i>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
                </i></p>
                <p>Understand what you want, understand improvement comes from practice, understand your emotions and how to best utilise them.</p>

                <p><i>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</i></p>
                <p>
                    Nothing too surprising, most things covered in it is something I’ve encountered in everyday life. It’s just never something I actively think about
                </p>
                
                <p><i>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</i></p>
                <p>Being honest with myself.</p>

                <p>
                    <i>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interpersonal skills are valuable in a team environment and it’s easier to learn when you understand your motivations and can manage your emotions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve gained more appreciation for core skills after foundations but with the hectic schedule coming up for boot camp I will always prioritise improving my technical skills if I am short on time. I believe this will have more benefits in the short term.
