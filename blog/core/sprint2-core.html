                <p>
                    Traditional book learning has never been a problem for me, I believe as long as I commit myself I will be able to get everything out of the technical portion of this course. My collaborative skills are not as developed as I want it to be along with a tendency to be a bit too dismissive. This is an area that I need to improve on and I believe it is an important aspect if I want to achieve my current career goals.
                </p>

                <h4>Goal and career pathway</h4>
                <p>
                    Acquire relevant marketable skills for me to work in the tech sector for the foreseeable future. This is my main reason for joining Dev Academy.
                </p>

                <h4>Commitment</h4>
                <p>
                    I intend to commit all my time to this course and fully engage myself in group projects. I will treat all others with respect and understanding. My plan is to complete all learning and course work before the end of Friday and weekends will be used for my own practice and further research.
                </p>

                <h4>Asking for assistance</h4>
                <p>
                    I will use the official Slack channels to ask for help with regards to course material. For issues concerning the course itself I will use the contact emails on the Dev Academy website.
                </p>

                <h4>Expectation from facilitators</h4>
                <p>
                Quick and honest feedback on my progress, if I am not meeting expectations in any area I expect to be quickly informed of this fact and any adjustments needed to be made. Reply to questions in a reasonable timeframe. Explanations on how the course materials are relevant.
                </p>
