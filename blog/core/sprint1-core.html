                <h3>Values Identity and Strength</h3>
            </header>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Values and identity, not really something that I spent time on or thought about at all to be honest. After reflecting on it a bit I guess one thing that I value highly is honesty. Not the honesty where you reveal your deepest darkest secrets but rather just simply being honest with yourself as well as when dealing with others. There are a few others but they all can sum up as ‘be a decent person’, it’s a bit cliche but I like to think that I am one or try to be at least.

                    Trying to understand my strengths and limitations is also something that I hardly ever did but did manage to pin down a few. Determination and focus, especially when I have a target in mind. Coupled with my previous studies which has given me an understanding on the theory side of things I believe these will be useful while I strive towards my current career goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to have firm grasp on a subject before moving onto the next and often lose my sense of time during the process. This could be quite a detriment if I commit more than necessary to one task while others begin to build up to an overwhelming extent, creating unnecessary stress and headache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a situation at another previous job a co-worker asked me to clarify on something that I thought was completely obvious and I let them know as much before going back to what I was doing. What’s obvious to me might not be so to someone else. Rather than dismiss the request out of hand and creating unnecessary tension, I should’ve simply said I was busy and will get back to them later.
