                <h3>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h3>

                    Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to forge and reorganise neural circuits. These circuits can be created and altered through various stimuli such as learning new skills, practicing existing skills, environmental influences or brain damage. An important concept in learning, neuroplasticity was initially thought to only occur during childhood but is now understood to extend into adulthood as well, though to a lesser extent.

                    An important benefit of neuroplasticity is that it improves a person’s ability to learn new knowledge and abilities. Through constant practice and reflection new connections are formed and existing pathways are reinforced and strengthened. As stated earlier neuroplasticity persists into adulthood and some activities that help improve this are exercise and exposing yourself to new environments and concepts like learning a new language or taking up painting.

                    The wikipedia article on neuroplasticity is a great resource covering its history and exploring the different subjects where this concept applies. <a style="color: blue;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity"><i>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity</i></a>

                    A concept that is closely related to neuroplasticity is the Growth Mindset, a term coined by Dr. Carol Dweck. This is the mindset that intelligence and abilities are not hard set and they can be improved through learning and practice. When faced with a difficult problem those who adopt a growth mindset see it as a challenge that can be solved through hard work and practice rather than dreading at the difficulty and questioning their own ability. Research from Dr Dweck has shown classrooms that teach with a growth mindset approach has seen major improvements in the student’s academic results.

                    While the name is new to me, the concept for growth mindset is not. Throughout my schooling it was always taught to me that hard work and dedication is needed to achieve the desired results. Rather I follow these directions or not was another matter altogether.

                    For this course I intend to approach it with the growth mindset, with the schedule expected to be intense and demanding. It's important to see the upcoming contents as a challenge to be overcome rather than allowing self doubt to set in and jeopardizing my learning.
